## Features <a name='features'></a>

TodayTask provides essential functionalities to keep your task management straightforward. The application includes an intuitive interface with an input field for adding tasks and two panels: Active Tasks and Completed Tasks.

### Check Icon <a name='check-icon'></a>

Upon completion of a task, clicking the check icon automatically moves it from the Active Tasks list to the Completed Tasks panel. The task text is struck through, indicating its completion. Notably, the Completed Tasks panel does not feature the check icon.

### Edit Icon <a name='edit-icon'></a>

The Edit icon allows users to modify their tasks seamlessly. Clicking on the icon transforms the task into an editable field. Pressing Enter or Return saves the changes. This feature is available in both the Active Tasks and Completed Tasks panels.

### Remove Icon <a name='remove-icon'></a>

Tasks that are no longer needed can be effortlessly removed using the small trash icon on the far left.

### Drag and Drop Functionality <a name='drag-and-drop'></a>

![Drag and Drop Functionality](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnc7potxo/image/upload/v1700426639/ReadMe-Images/TodayTask/TodayTask_bypfpl.gif)

TodayTask offers a convenient Drag and Drop feature. Users can rearrange tasks within the Active Tasks and Completed Tasks panels or move them between the two. When a task is moved to the Completed Tasks panel, it is automatically marked as completed, while moving it back to the Active Tasks panel removes the strikethrough.
